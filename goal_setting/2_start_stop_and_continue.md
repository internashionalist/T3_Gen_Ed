# Start, Stop, and Continue

## Where do you spend most of your time?

    The vast majority of my time is divided between three locations: the real estate brokerage office, the restaurant where I tend bar, and my apartment. If/when I find the time, I can be found at a nearby bar having a whiskey.

## What is one thing you could start doing (that you are not currently doing) that if you did on a regular basis, would make a tremendous positive difference for you?

    Honestly, I think I’d benefit from a routine. Although I do the same things most days, there’s no rhythm to it - no structure. A bit of planning and time-blocking might do wonders for my state of mind. I complete the tasks I need to complete, but there’s strength in ritual, whether at the start or end of each day. I don’t even shower the same each day. I should take some time and develop healthy habits to lessen stress.

## What is one thing you could stop doing that would also make a positive difference?

    I should really stop staying up all night when it’s not absolutely necessary. I probably skip every fourth night of sleep on average, and it’s usually due to a combination of: lack of a static sleep schedule, poor planning, overuse of stimulants (nothing illegal), and stress.

## What is something you are currently doing that you believe is helpful and would like to continue?

    I’m beginning, through therapy, to separate myself from my emotions. I’m not devastatingly depressed or paralyzingly anxious; I’m feeling depressed or anxious RIGHT NOW. The difference between experiencing emotion as temporary, as opposed to constant, is crucial when the goal is shortening episodes and decreasing overall stress.
