# Purpose

    This project will help you understand how to send professional emails and/or messaging. This not only will show your competencies, but also character, work ethic and attention to detail. Effective communication is a crucial skill in the software engineering field, where clear and professional interactions can significantly impact project success, client relationships, and team dynamics. Emailing is a very popular form of communication in the business world, and if not practiced, you can spend more time explaining yourself in many threads, instead of solving problems more efficiently.

    Professional emails/messages range in format and tone depending on the purpose of the email and the relationship between the sender and recipient. Read the description for the assignment requirements below.

# Description

    Below are three scenarios. Using the provided resources on email best practices, craft a professional email addressing each scenario. Once you’ve completed your emails, send each to your instructor and upload a screenshot of the sent emails to task 0.

    Scenario 1: Communicating a Project Status Update to Your Team and Project Manager
    You are a junior developer working on a team that is building a new feature for an existing web application. The feature involves adding a user profile section where customers can update their personal information. The team has encountered a small delay because the database schema required some changes that were not anticipated. Your project manager has asked you to send an email update summarizing the current status of the feature, including what has been completed, what tasks are still pending, and any challenges you’ve encountered. Your team members will rely on this update to understand what needs to be done next, and your project manager will use it to adjust the project timeline if needed.

    Potential Tasks for scenario 1:

        * Design the user profile interface.
        * Implement front-end form elements for the user profile.
        * Set up back-end logic to handle profile data submission.
        * Adjust the database schema to accommodate new profile fields.
        * Integrate API calls for fetching and updating user data.
        * Develop validation rules for user input on the profile form.
        * Write unit tests for the new profile features.

    Scenario 2: Addressing a Bug Report Submitted by a Colleague, Suspecting User Error Rather Than a Code Issue
    You are an entry-level developer working on a team that is testing a new feature for an internal company tool. A colleague from the QA team has reported a bug, stating that the tool isn’t saving user settings correctly. After reviewing the report, you suspect that the issue might not be with the code itself but could be due to a misunderstanding of how the settings are supposed to be used. You need to write an email to your colleague, explaining your findings, suggesting they try testing the feature again with specific instructions, and offering to help if they encounter the same problem.

    Scenario 3: Requesting Clarification on Task Requirements from Your Team Lead
    You are an entry-level software engineer assigned to develop a small feature for a web application your team is working on. The task involves implementing a new form where users can submit feedback. However, the task description provided by your team lead is a bit vague, and you’re not entirely sure what fields the form should include or how the data should be handled. You need to send an email to your team lead to request clarification on the specific requirements so you can proceed with confidence.
