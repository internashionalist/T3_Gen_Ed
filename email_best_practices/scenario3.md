Subject: Clarification on Feedback Form Requirements

Good morning, [Team Lead’s Name],

I’ve been working on the feedback form feature, and I’ve made some initial progress. The current draft is attached for your reference, but I’d like to confirm a few details to ensure the form meets your expectations:

Are there any additional fields you’d like to see on the form beyond those included?
What validation rules or formatting requirements should I set up?
How we planning on handling the submitted data? I could have it emailed, store it in a database, or both.
I matched the design to other existing forms, but are there any branding updates I should be aware of?

Let me know if you have any feedback, further guidance, or just advice on how I can refine the work. I’ll be happy to make any adjustments based on your input.

Thanks so much,
