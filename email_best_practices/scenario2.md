Subject: Follow-Up on User Settings Issue in “Config Pro”

Hey Sam!

I appreciate the thorough report on the issue with user settings not saving correctly. I’ve reviewed the code and tested the feature, but I’m having trouble duplicating the problem.

I’ve gone into the code, and I think I’ve got a solution, if you don’t mind checking it from the user’s point of view for me again. If I’m right, the settings should save automatically when you click the “Save Changes” button, BUT they only take effect after refreshing the dashboard or re-logging into the application.

Follow these steps, and we’ll see if things don’t come together for us:

Steps to Test:
 1. Log in using your credentials.
 2. Navigate to the “User Preferences” tab in the Settings menu.
 3. Make a change to one of the settings (it doesn’t matter what: just update the theme, notification preferences, something like that).
 4. Click the “Save Changes” button at the bottom of the page.
 5. Refresh the dashboard or log out and log back in.
 6. Check to confirm that the updated settings have been applied.

If the issue persists after following these steps, please let me know. I’d be happy to assist further or join in for a live testing session to help identify any additional factors that might be causing the problem.

Thank you for your attention to this, and I’m here to help if you need anything further.

Cheers,
